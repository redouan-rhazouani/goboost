# GoBoost
GoBoost is a set of pure general purpose libraries for the go programming language.
It has been inspired by [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) one of the best [C++](https://isocpp.org) library projects in the world.

## Design Goals
GoBoost packages should feel to a user like any other standard go packages.
To achieve this goal we try to follow some basic design principles and guidelines:
1. Write components that do one thing, and do it well
2. An interface should be easy to use and hard to misuse
3. Write generic and composable components
4. Write idiomatic go code
